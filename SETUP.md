# Setup Instructions

## âœ… Development Server Status
The development server is now running successfully at `http://localhost:5173`

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### 1. Download Walrus WASM File
You need to download the `walrus_bg.wasm` file to make the Walrus integration work:

1. Go to [Walrus Releases](https://github.com/mystenlabs/walrus/releases)
2. Download the latest `walrus_bg.wasm` file
3. Place it in the `public/` directory of your project

### 2. Alternative: Use CDN (Recommended for Development)
If you don't want to download the WASM file, you can update the Walrus service to use a CDN:

```typescript
// In src/services/walrusService.ts, update the constructor:
this.walrusClient = new WalrusClient({
  suiClient: this.suiClient,
  wasmUrl: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mysten/walrus/dist/walrus_bg.wasm',
  aggregatorUrl: WALRUS_TESTNET_AGGREGATOR,
  publisherUrl: WALRUS_TESTNET_PUBLISHER,
});
```
