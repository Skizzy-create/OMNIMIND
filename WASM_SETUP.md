# Walrus WASM Setup

## Required: Download walrus_bg.wasm

To make Walrus file uploads work, you need to download the WASM file:

1. Go to: https://github.com/mystenlabs/walrus/releases
2. Download the latest `walrus_bg.wasm` file
3. Place it in the `public/` directory

## Alternative: Use CDN (for development)

You can also update the service to use a CDN-hosted WASM file by modifying the `wasmUrl` in `src/services/walrusService.ts`:

```typescript
wasmUrl: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mysten/walrus/dist/walrus_bg.wasm'
```

## Current Status

✅ Walrus SDK API updated to latest version
✅ Upload flow using `writeFilesFlow` method
✅ Progress tracking through all phases
✅ Upload relay configuration
✅ Error handling and validation

The frontend is now ready to upload files to Walrus decentralized storage!
