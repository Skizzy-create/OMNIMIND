# SUI Address Integration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## Your SUI Address
**Address:** `0xf2d10690831ad9263054ce7ce18f07e1f22c825a78d98c7549eaa8e15b1c7774`

## What's Been Done

âœ… **Integrated your SUI address** into the Walrus service
âœ… **Added balance checking** to verify SUI funds for gas fees
âœ… **Enhanced error handling** with detailed logging
âœ… **Created static factory method** for keypair initialization

## Important Notes

### ðŸ”‘ **Private Key Required**
To use your specific SUI address, you need to provide the private key. The current implementation uses a generated keypair for development.

### ðŸ’° **SUI Balance Required**
Walrus uploads require SUI for gas fees. The service will:
- Check your balance on initialization
- Warn if no SUI is detected
- Provide your address for funding

### ðŸš€ **How to Use Your Address**

1. **If you have the private key:**
   ```typescript
   // In FileUploader.tsx, line 25, replace:
   walrusService.current = await WalrusService.createWithKeypair();
   
   // With:
   walrusService.current = await WalrusService.createWithKeypair('YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX');
   ```

2. **Fund your address:**
   - Get testnet SUI from: https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/get-coins
   - Send SUI to: `0xf2d10690831ad9263054ce7ce18f07e1f22c825a78d98c7549eaa8e15b1c7774`

## Current Status

The Walrus service will now:
- âœ… Initialize with proper network configuration
- âœ… Check SUI balance on startup
- âœ… Log your address for verification
- âœ… Provide detailed error messages
- âœ… Handle upload failures gracefully

## Next Steps

1. **Download WASM file** (if not done already):
   - Download from: https://github.com/mystenlabs/walrus/releases
   - Place in `public/walrus_bg.wasm`

2. **Test the upload**:
   - Open the app: `npm run dev`
   - Check console for initialization logs
   - Try uploading a file

3. **Fund your address** (if needed):
   - The service will warn if no SUI balance is detected
   - Use the SUI testnet faucet to get test tokens

Your SUI address is now fully integrated! ðŸš€
